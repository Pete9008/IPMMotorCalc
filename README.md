# IPMMotorCalc
This project is intended to allow IPM motor parameters to be calculated from OpenInverter web plots.

It is in the very early stages of development, use with caution and do sanity checks on all results produced using it.

Rs tuning should only be done on logs produced while the motor shaft is locked.

Ld, Lq and flux linkage tuning should only be done on logs taken while the motor is spinning.
